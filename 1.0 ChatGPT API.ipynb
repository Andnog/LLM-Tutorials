    "### What is ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text based on given prompts. It excels in natural language understanding and can be harnessed for various applications, from content creation to conversational interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is built upon the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. GPT models are based on transformer neural networks, utilizing attention mechanisms for contextual understanding. In the case of ChatGPT, the model is specifically fine-tuned for conversational contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it work ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind ChatGPT's capabilities is a vast neural network that has undergone extensive pre-training on diverse internet text. This pre-training equips the model with an inherent understanding of grammar, context, and a wide range of topics. The transformer architecture, with attention mechanisms, enables ChatGPT to grasp contextual relationships, crucial for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ChatGPT API serves as the gateway to unlocking the model's potential programmatically. Through HTTP requests, users can engage with ChatGPT by providing a series of messages, each with a designated role ('system', 'user', or 'assistant') and content. The API facilitates dynamic conversations, allowing users to instruct the \n",
    "model and receive tailored responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases and Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The versatility of ChatGPT makes it applicable across various domains. Explore use cases such as content creation, code generation, conversational agents, and more. Whether you're looking to enhance user interactions or automate certain tasks, ChatGPT's applications are diverse and impactful."

    "### Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into using ChatGPT via the OpenAI package, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python (version 3.6 or higher)\n",
    "- OpenAI Python library (`openai`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the OpenAI library using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Get started with a simple example to make your first interaction with ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "\n",
    "openai.chat.completions.create(\n",
    "  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n",
    "  messages=[\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n",
    "        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"},\n",
    "    ]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates a basic interaction, where the system message sets the assistant's behavior, and the user message instructs the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Usage with AzureOpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "For users working with Azure, you can use the `AzureOpenAI` client. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from azure_openai import AzureOpenAI\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "client = AzureOpenAI(\n",
    "  api_key = os.getenv(\"AZURE_OPENAI_KEY\"),  \n",

    "### Detail explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature**: In short, the lower the `temperature`, the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing temperature could lead to more randomness, which encourages more diverse or creative outputs. You are essentially increasing the weights of the other possible tokens. In terms of application, you might want to use a lower temperature value for tasks like fact-based QA to encourage more factual and concise responses. For poem generation or other creative tasks, it might be beneficial to increase the temperature value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top P**: A sampling technique with `temperature`, called nucleus sampling, where you can control how deterministic the model is. If you are looking for exact and factual answers keep this low. If you are looking for more diverse responses, increase to a higher value. If you use Top P it means that only the tokens comprising the `top_p` probability mass are considered for responses, so a low `top_p` value selects the most confident responses. This means that a high `top_p` value will enable the model to look at more possible words, including less likely ones, leading to more diverse outputs. The general recommendation is to alter temperature or Top P but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max Length**: You can manage the number of tokens the model generates by adjusting the `max length`. Specifying a max length helps you prevent long or irrelevant responses and control costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop Sequences**: A `stop sequence` is a string that stops the model from generating tokens. Specifying stop sequences is another way to control the length and structure of the model's response. For example, you can tell the model to generate lists that have no more than 10 items by adding `\"11\"` as a stop sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frequency Penalty**: The `frequency penalty` applies a penalty on the next token proportional to how many times that token already appeared in the response and prompt. The higher the frequency penalty, the less likely a word will appear again. This setting reduces the repetition of words in the model's response by giving tokens that appear more a higher penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presence Penalty**: The `presence penalty` also applies a penalty on repeated tokens but, unlike the frequency penalty, the penalty is the same for all repeated tokens. A token that appears twice and a token that appears 10 times are penalized the same. This setting prevents the model from repeating phrases too often in its response. If you want the model to generate diverse or creative text, you might want to use a higher presence penalty. Or, if you need the model to stay focused, try using a lower presence penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to `temperature` and `top_p`, the general recommendation is to alter the frequency or presence penalty but not both.\n"

    "## Section 4: Parameters and Structure of Calling ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crafting Effective Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guiding Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specificity:** Be explicit and detailed in your prompts. Clearly communicate the desired format or structure for the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextualization:** Provide context in user messages to guide the model's understanding. System messages set the tone for the assistant's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Conversation:** Build conversations with multiple turns. This helps the model maintain context and produce coherent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding API Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model:** Specify the ChatGPT model to use. For example, \"gpt-3.5-turbo.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Message Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Messages:** Compose an array of messages, each with a role (\"system,\" \"user,\" or \"assistant\") and content (text of the message). Order matters, with the conversation evolving sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System Message\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role:** \"system\"\n",
    "- **Content:** Set the assistant's behavior with a concise system message at the beginning of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role:** \"user\"\n",
    "- **Content:** Clearly instruct the model in user messages. Use detailed language and iterate the conversation for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assistant Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role:** \"assistant\"\n",
    "- **Content:** Use assistant messages to provide additional context or information to guide the model's understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting and Common Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unintended Output\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model provides unintended or undesirable responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refine prompts: Experiment with different phrasing and provide more explicit instructions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Adjust hyperparameters: Fine-tune temperature, max tokens, and other settings for desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Response Length\n",
    "\n",
    "For controlling response length:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilize max tokens: Set an appropriate max tokens value to limit the length of responses."
